## About Me ## 
Hi, I'm Charlotte (she/her) :wave:
* Second year dual-degree in Public Health (Community Health Science) and Urban Planning (Environmental Analysis and Policy) 🏘️ ❤️
* Born and raised in Merced, CA on an almond orchard 🌳
* Studied Public Health and Spanish at UC Berkeley 🐻
* Worked in healthcare consulting in San Francisco 🏥
* **Academic Interests** (they’re all over the place) — sustainability, climate resilience, resource stewardship and land use, environmental justice, access to healthcare and green space, food systems, health equity, aging, community development 
* **Personal Interests** -- cooking, art/crafting, tennis, k-dramas, nature walks, my calico cat Sunday (rescued from above-mentioned almond orchard).

## Course Description ##
From my understanding, this course will provide us with a foundational knowledge of spatial data science as well as with a toolbox of hard skills (Python and GIS) that we can use to effectively visualize data and tell stories as planners.

## Project Ideas ##
Some ideas I've been thinking about recently but I'm excited to dive into anything related to environment, community, and health!
* **Climate Change & PEH**
  * Impact of extreme weather events (ie heat/floods/“combined risk events”) on unsheltered PEH (ie displacement/death/injury) in LA County
  * Asset mapping of existing emergency resources and shelters in LA county in order to identify potential spaces and resources for additional emergency activation
* **Climate Change & Flood Mitigation**
  * Create visualization of future flood plains in CA with climate change predictions and identify high flood risk areas and priority communities 
* **Health/Access**
  * Explore the relationship between senior-centered community and healthcare resources and senior population concentrations, income level, and race.
  * Create map of healthcare resources across CA and how they vary by census tract

## My Objectives ##
* Become proficient in Python and GIS in order to be able to apply them irl
* Gain a better technical understanding of spatial data science, current challenges and best practices in the field 
* Hone my data selection and analysis skills to create the most effective visualizations and narratives
